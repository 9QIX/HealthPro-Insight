## Project Overview

HealthPro Insight is a web project designed to facilitate doctor appointment bookings for medical establishments such as clinics and hospitals. It offers patients the convenience of requesting appointments online while helping doctors efficiently manage their schedules. The system has three primary user roles: administrators, doctors, and patients.

- **Administrators** can add, edit, and delete doctors, schedule sessions, and view patient details and bookings.

- **Doctors** can view their appointments, scheduled sessions, and patient details, and manage their accounts.

- **Patients (Clients)** can make appointments online, create accounts, view their booking history, and manage their account settings.
